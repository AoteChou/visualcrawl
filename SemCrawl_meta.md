#### documents are now fuzzy

##### web 1.0

*documents* are defined by human authors

- data is drawn from arbitrary sources and crafted directly into content by human authors
- content is split between documents by human judgement on a per-document basis (as in the chapters and sections of a book)
- data is interlinked by links between documents

##### web 2.0

*document classes* are defined by human authored templates

- data is drawn from arbitrary sources into relational databases
- content is extracted and rendered from relational databases according to templates (as in XSLT and CSS)
- data is interlinked by links between document classes

##### web 3.0

*document representations* of resources are defined by human authored algorithms

- data is drawn from arbitrary sources into triplestores
- content is extracted from triplestores by algorithmically discovering a relevant subgraph (as in Concise Bounded Description or Minimal Self-Contained Graph)
- data is interlinked by entity equivalencies and relations
